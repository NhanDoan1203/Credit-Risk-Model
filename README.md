🧠 Credit Risk Prediction Model
This project explores and builds classification models to predict credit risk based on customer financial data. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes demographic, behavioral, and financial indicators of loan applicants.

📌 Objectives:
Identify key factors associated with credit default risk

Build and evaluate machine learning models to support data-driven credit policy decisions

⚙️ Tools & Techniques:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Random Forest & Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers

Data visualization for feature exploration

Accuracy score & confusion matrix for model evaluation

📈 Results:
Achieved over 76% accuracy on test data

Uncovered key predictors such as income level, credit history, and loan amount
